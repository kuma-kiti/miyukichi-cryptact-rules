これをそのまま**国際的に通じる正確な英語版**として翻訳します。
Cryptactフォーマット仕様に即した用語（PnL, fee, rebate, funding, realized profit/loss）で統一しました。

## 🔹 Common Rules

1. **Read numbers exactly as shown** — no rounding, no interpretation (error tolerance ±0 is strictly prohibited).
   *Note: Copy what you see. Only add when summing; never “correct” numbers.*
2. **If both PnL and Fee are 0, skip the row.**
3. **Sort transactions chronologically (ascending by timestamp).**
4. **Output format:** No header, tab-delimited (Excel-compatible).
5. **Set the margin currency accurately for each source.**
6. **Datetime format:** `YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm:ss`

## 💰 **GRVT Rules** (USDT-based Derivatives)

* **Source:** GRVT
* **Base currency:** USDT
* **Fee currency:** USDT

### Recording Principles

1. *Realized PnL does **not** include fees.*
2. *The “Fee” field must be recorded separately as a fee row (LOSS). Never combine with PnL.*
3. *If Realized PnL > 0 → record as **BONUS** (Realized Profit).*
   *If Realized PnL < 0 → record as **LOSS** (Realized Loss).*
4. *If Fee < 0 → record as **BONUS** (Maker Rebate). Quantity = rebate amount. Comment: “Maker Rebate”.*
5. *If Fee > 0 → record as **LOSS** (Fee Payment). Quantity = fee amount. Comment: “Fee”.*
6. *Funding reward:*

   * Positive → **BONUS** (“Funding Received”)
   * Negative → **LOSS** (“Funding Payment”)
7. *If both PnL = 0 and Fee = 0 → skip the record.*
8. *Sort all outputs in chronological ascending order.*

* **Margin currency:** USDC
* *Realized PnL already includes fees.*
* *Fee field is always 0.*
* *Funding reward:* + → BONUS, − → LOSS.
* *Maker rebate:* Add an extra BONUS row.
* *If both PnL and Fee are 0 → skip.*

## 💎 **Hyperliquid (Hype) Rules**

* **Source:** Hyperliquid
* **Margin currency:** USDC
* *Closed PnL already includes fees (final net result).*
* *Fee field is always 0.*
* *Funding reward:* + → BONUS, − → LOSS.
* *Maker rebate:* Add an extra BONUS row.
* *If both PnL and Fee are 0 → skip.*

## 📘 **GRVT Fee Verification Checklist**

(Optional — see separate document.)

---

## 🧾 **Daily Aggregation Rules**

1. The user enters **“0”** to trigger *Formatting Mode.*
   → AI replies: “Entered Formatting Mode.”
2. Paste the raw **trade history** of GRVT / Pacifica / Hype directly.
3. The AI automatically performs:

   * PnL sign check → determine BONUS or LOSS
   * Fee < 0 → add BONUS (Maker Rebate)
   * Fee > 0 → add LOSS (Fee Payment)
   * Skip rows where PnL = 0 and Fee = 0
4. Finally, output **only the summarized results** for
   BONUS / LOSS / Rebate / Fee
   (in Cryptact tab-delimited format, no intermediate data).

## 🧩 **Checkpoints (for AI self-verification)**

☑ When **Fee** is negative, a **BONUS (Maker Rebate)** line is added correctly.  
☑ When **Fee** is positive, a **LOSS (Fee)** line is added correctly.  
☑ When **Funding** is positive, it is recorded as **BONUS (Funding Received)**.  
☑ When **Funding** is negative, it is recorded as **LOSS (Funding Payment)**.  
☑ Rows where both **PnL = 0** and **Fee = 0** are omitted.  
☑ All entries (**BONUS / LOSS / Rebate / Fee**) are sorted in **chronological (ascending)** order.  
☑ Daily or period-end summaries output in **6 categories**:  
  **(1)** Profit, **(2)** Loss, **(3)** Funding Received, **(4)** Funding Payment, **(5)** Maker Rebate, **(6)** Fee.  
☑ **Categories that do not exist are not shown** — non-existent divisions are omitted (no empty placeholders).
